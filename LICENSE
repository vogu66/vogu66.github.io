MIT License -- modified

Since this is a website, well, a few modifications are needed. The following
paragraphs are the original version of the MIT licence, and anything said in the
current paragraph primes over the rest of the licence. If a point is not cited
in the current paragraph, the rest of the license applies. The fact that this
license refers to a website means there are 3 different part in the source code :
the "code" (anything directly related to the use use of html, css, js, or anything
similar), the design (the way the site looks) and the content (anything that isn't
code, basically hard-coded data). The content and the design of the website may 
not be copied. The content can be referenced or cited. As for the software as 
described later, copying it in its entirety would both copy the content and the
design. Thus, the definition of Software is overruled in this paragraph as any
non-trivial portion of the code used in the website, if there is any. In case of
grey area in the definitions, please contact the developper.

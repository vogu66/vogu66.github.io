# Home Page

**Unfinished !**

In this repository is the source code for my presentation page. See [here](https://vogu66.github.io/) for the website.

Since it is my home page, well, I'm gonna take some protection about the content. Basically, make sure you read the licence, I added a paragraph at the beginning. Overall, it translates as : take parts of the code, that's fair game (still, read the license, there are conditions), but don't copy the design (so basically you can't copy the whole site) and the content is mine, so, not to be copied either. It won't disappear anyways. I guess you can cite it and reference it, if, for some unfathomable reason, you want to, but that's about it.

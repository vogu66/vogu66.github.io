<p> This page is pretty straightforward, or it would be but for a single detail : there exist people who use web crawlers to get email addresses and spam them. Obviously, my main address won't be displayed here, but even then, it should be avoided. And Captcha isn't enough, because the source on github is definitely crawl-able. Thus, even the source has to be concealed, which is why there will be two layers of protection when trying to access it : </p>

If you found some stuff that doesn't work as it should (and if it's obviously not just something I haven't done yet, since for now I'm just building the site -- or not, depends if you come from the far future or not), you can file an [issue](https://github.com/vogu66/vogu66.github.io/issues). I should, at some point, see it. Alternatively, supposing I coded it already, you can [contact me](./contact.html).

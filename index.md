## About this site...

I'm writing this website as a front to showcase my projects, as mostly everyone else, the difference being that, as of now, I barely have any completed project, and none of them is of any importance. This page is just a provisionary page in case, and will be suitably modified if -- when -- I create anything of note.

## About me

I'm an engineering student, whose main focus is definitely not computer science. I do, however, coding stuff, so I do that a lot in my free time. I'd love to dabble with every programming language I know of, but I can't. So, I learn them as they appear on my path.
